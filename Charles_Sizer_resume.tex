\emph{Objective: }Advance my career in a position that lets me emphasize  data driven problem solving. %\\

Charles's career has focused on transitioning products with unique processing challenges from development into production.  Uses iterative, constructive method to convert raw, proof-of-concept production lines into automated systems integrated with higher levels of business planning and tracking. Strong track record of troubleshooting enabled by deep understanding of information systems, electrical systems, software and fluid processes. Solves complex problems using proven data driven approaches, building models to evaluate steady-state and transient phenomena. My favorite tasks are tasks which can, with sufficient thoughtfulness, be automated.
