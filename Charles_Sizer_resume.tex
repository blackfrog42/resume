\noindent \textit{Mathematician. Engineer. Analyst. Manager.}\\\\
\emph{Objective: }Use my start up business experience to obtain a challenging position where I will use my modeling, creative problem-solving, and analytical skills to drive positive business outcomes.  \\

\noindent I am a mathematician. I applied my skills to food-industry R\&D and operations where, at a succession of bold start-ups, I honed my business understanding. For nearly fifteen years, I was the go-to when complicated problems needed sophisticated spreadsheets to make them comprehensible.  I worked with senior leaders to capture business data and inform company strategies and decisions. 
%I solve complex problems by building models to evaluate steady-state and transient phenomena.
%I am a master at excel; I've even had requested features added by Microsoft.
