\emph{Objective: }Advance my career in a position emphasizing  data driven problem solving. \\

My career has focused on transitioning food products with unique processing challenges from development into production. 
I have a track record of applying iterative, constructive methods to proof-of-concept processing lines to create automated production systems which are integrated with upper levels of business logic. 
I have a strong history of troubleshooting enabled by understanding of fluid processes, electrical systems and software. 
I solve complex problems using proven data driven approaches and building models to evaluate steady-state and transient phenomena.
